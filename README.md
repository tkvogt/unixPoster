unixPoster
==========

A huge Unix poster (Din A0 or Din A1) showing the most important commands with examples.
The special aspect about this poster is that it was programmed with the
Haskell diagrams library instead of using a tool like Inkscape.

Entering

```Shell
ghc --make poster.hs
```
or go to the folder and
```Shell
cabal install
```
builds an executable, and entering:

./poster -o unixposter.pdf -w 1685

produces [unixposter.pdf](unixposter.pdf)
